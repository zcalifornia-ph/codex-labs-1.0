## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use coordinated disclosure.
Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Send reports to:

- Maintainer: Zildjian E. California
- Email: zecalifornia@up.edu.ph

Please include:

- affected file, notebook, or component
- reproducible steps or proof of concept
- expected vs actual behavior
- potential impact and severity estimate
- suggested fix (optional)

## Response Targets

- acknowledgment within 72 hours
- initial triage within 7 calendar days
- remediation plan on a best-effort basis as soon as triage is complete

Complex issues may require additional investigation time.

## Disclosure and Credit

- We will coordinate disclosure timing with reporters when possible.
- We will credit reporters unless anonymity is requested.
- We ask reporters to avoid privacy violations, service disruption, or data destruction while testing.
